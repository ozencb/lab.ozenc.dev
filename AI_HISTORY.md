   - ES modules configuration with proper build and development scripts

2. **Created `server/tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript configuration extending root config
   - Optimized for Node.js ES modules with ESNext module resolution
   - Configured for declaration file generation and source maps
   - Composite project setup for efficient monorepo builds
   - Includes proper include/exclude patterns for server-specific files

3. **Created `server/src/index.ts`** - Main Express.js application with comprehensive setup
   - **Security middleware**: Helmet with CSP, CORS with environment-based origins
   - **Performance middleware**: Compression and Morgan logging (dev/prod modes)
   - **Health check endpoint**: `/api/health` with server status and uptime
   - **Error handling**: 404 handler and global error middleware with development/production modes
   - **Environment configuration**: Dotenv integration with PORT and NODE_ENV support
   - **TypeScript types**: Proper Express types with Request/Response annotations

4. **Created `server/.env.example`** - Environment variables template
   - Server configuration (PORT, NODE_ENV)
   - CORS origins for development/production
   - Security and logging configuration examples

#### Technical Features Implemented:
- **Modern ES modules** with proper Node.js compatibility
- **Security-first approach** with helmet, CORS, and input validation
- **Environment-aware logging** (morgan dev vs combined)
- **Comprehensive error handling** with proper HTTP status codes
- **Health monitoring** endpoint for deployment readiness checks
- **TypeScript best practices** with strict typing and proper interfaces

#### Build & Verification:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors (`pnpm type-check`)
- ✅ Build generates clean JavaScript with source maps (`pnpm build`)
- ✅ All dependencies properly installed via PNPM workspace
- ✅ Server ready for development (`pnpm dev`) and production (`pnpm start`)

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `server/package.json` (new file - 32 lines, 964B)
- `server/tsconfig.json` (new file - 29 lines, 718B)  
- `server/src/index.ts` (new file - 78 lines, 2.2KB)
- `server/.env.example` (new file - 9 lines, 181B)
- `TODO.md` (updated - marked task complete)

#### Project Status:
- **Current Phase:** Phase 3.1 - Server Setup (in progress)
- **Next Task:** Set up TypeScript configuration for server (already completed as part of this task)
- **Overall Progress:** 13/229 tasks completed from TODO list

#### Technical Notes:
- Express.js server follows modern best practices with security middleware
- TypeScript configuration optimized for server-side development with ES modules
- Foundation established for static file serving, routing, and API endpoints
- Ready for next phase implementation (manifest reading, project routing, static serving)
- Development workflow supports hot reloading with tsx watch mode

#### Next Steps:
1. Set up TypeScript configuration for server (already completed)
2. Create basic routing structure
3. Set up static file serving for built projects
4. Continue with Phase 3.2 - Core Routing Logic
