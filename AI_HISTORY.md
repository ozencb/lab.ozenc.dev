## Session 1 - Project Initialization (December 2024)

### Task Completed: Set up PNPM workspace configuration
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Commit:** `2ebb299` - "Set up PNPM workspace configuration"

#### What was done:
1. **Created `pnpm-workspace.yaml`** - PNPM workspace configuration file
   - Configured workspace packages for monorepo structure:
     - `apps/*` - Main applications (hub and individual projects)
     - `server` - Backend routing server
     - `shared` - Shared utilities and types  
     - `scripts` - Build and deployment scripts

2. **Updated `TODO.md`** - Marked first task as completed
   - Changed `- [ ] Set up PNPM workspace configuration` to `- [x] Set up PNPM workspace configuration`

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (new file)
- `TODO.md` (updated - marked task complete)

#### Project Status:
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1.1 - Initialize Project Structure
- **Next Task:** Create root `package.json` with workspace dependencies
- **Overall Progress:** 1/232 tasks completed from TODO list

#### Technical Notes:
- PNPM workspace is now properly configured for the monorepo structure
- Ready to proceed with creating the root package.json file
- All workspace packages are defined according to the planned directory structure

#### Next Steps:
1. Create root `package.json` with workspace dependencies
2. Set up TypeScript configuration at root level
3. Create basic `.gitignore` for the monorepo
4. Continue with Phase 1.1 tasks

### Task Completed: Create root package.json with workspace dependencies
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** December 2024  

#### What was done:
1. **Created `package.json`** - Root package.json for the monorepo
   - Configured as private package with workspace dependencies
   - Set up comprehensive script collection for development and production workflows:
     - Development: `dev`, `build`, `build:project`
     - Validation: `validate`, `add:project`, `remove:project`, `sync`
     - Code Quality: `lint`, `lint:fix`, `format`, `format:check`, `type-check`
     - Maintenance: `clean`, `install:all`, `test`
   
2. **Development Dependencies:**
   - TypeScript and Node.js types
   - ESLint with TypeScript, React, and accessibility plugins
   - Prettier for code formatting
   - Concurrently and cross-env for script execution

3. **Runtime Dependencies:**
   - Express.js for the backend server
   - Security and performance middleware (cors, helmet, compression)

4. **Workspace Configuration:**
   - Defined workspaces matching PNPM configuration
   - Set engine requirements (Node 18+, PNPM 8+)
   - Configured package manager and metadata

5. **Updated `TODO.md`** - Marked second task as completed
   - Changed `- [ ] Create root package.json with workspace dependencies` to `- [x] Create root package.json with workspace dependencies`

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `package.json` (new file)
- `TODO.md` (updated - marked task complete)

#### Project Status:
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1.1 - Initialize Project Structure
- **Next Task:** Set up TypeScript configuration at root level
- **Overall Progress:** 2/232 tasks completed from TODO list

#### Technical Notes:
- Root package.json provides comprehensive tooling for the entire monorepo
- All workspace packages are properly configured for PNPM
- Development and production dependencies are separated appropriately
- Script collection covers all major workflow needs identified in the TODO

#### Next Steps:
1. Set up TypeScript configuration at root level
2. Create basic `.gitignore` for the monorepo
3. Set up ESLint and Prettier configurations (optional)
4. Continue with Phase 1.2 - Directory Structure

### Task Completed: Set up TypeScript configuration at root level
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** December 2024  

#### What was done:
1. **Created `tsconfig.json`** - Root TypeScript configuration for the monorepo
   - Modern TypeScript setup with ES2022 target and strict mode
   - Configured for modern bundler module resolution
   - Set up comprehensive compiler options:
     - Strict type checking with additional safety options
     - React JSX support with modern transform
     - Source maps and declaration files for development
     - Incremental compilation for performance

2. **Monorepo Configuration:**
   - Project references for all workspace packages:
     - `./apps/hub` - Main React application
     - `./server` - Backend Express server
     - `./shared` - Shared utilities and types
     - `./scripts` - Build and deployment scripts
   - Path mapping aliases for clean imports:
     - `@shared/*` → `shared/*`
     - `@server/*` → `server/*`
     - `@scripts/*` → `scripts/*`

3. **Include/Exclude Configuration:**
   - Includes all workspace directories and TypeScript files
   - Excludes build artifacts, node_modules, and Next.js cache
   - Properly structured for workspace-specific configurations

4. **Updated `TODO.md`** - Marked third task as completed
   - Changed `- [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration at root level` to `- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration at root level`

#### Files Created/Modified:
- `tsconfig.json` (new file)
- `TODO.md` (updated - marked task complete)

#### Project Status:
- **Current Phase:** Phase 1.1 - Initialize Project Structure
- **Next Task:** Create basic `.gitignore` for the monorepo
- **Overall Progress:** 3/232 tasks completed from TODO list

#### Technical Notes:
- TypeScript configuration supports modern development workflows
- Project references enable efficient incremental builds across workspaces
- Path mapping provides clean import syntax for shared code
- Configuration is compatible with Vite, Next.js, and other modern tooling
- Foundation set for workspace-specific TypeScript configurations

#### Next Steps:
1. Create basic `.gitignore` for the monorepo
2. Set up ESLint and Prettier configurations (optional)
3. Continue with Phase 1.2 - Directory Structure
4. Begin creating the planned directory structure
