# lab.ozenc.dev

This project acts as a main hub for developing and hosting many different web applications built with the intention of experimentation. It is a PNPM monorepo with Typescript support. The projects within it can be written with any technology (React, Vue, Svelte, Pure JS, etc.) that supports this base architecture, and they need to work on browser environments. It will be hosted on this address: "lab.ozenc.dev".

The user should be able to just create a new application, add necessary code to make a buildable and runnable project, and the main page on "lab.ozenc.dev" should be able to list the project. When user navigates to the project from the main page, it should redirect to that projects slug URL, and then run it.

I want the whole thing to be easily deployable to a free-tier hosting service.
